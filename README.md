## Getting Started

This project consist of an application to check the weather of any city in the world. It makes an `Http` request to the 
`OpenWeather API` in order to get the current weather conditions of the desired city. Also it makes a request to the `Unsplash API`
in order to get a random image depending on the weather conditions of the requested city and placed as background.

#### Search bar

In order to get the current weather of any city in the world, fill the `input` with the name of the city in the search bar
choose the desired metric system by clicking the `C¬∞` or the `F¬∞` units, then click the `Q` button to make the request.
